- better error handling (down / nuke / lint all error badly if up hasn't been run, up errors badly if docker isn't running, etc.)
- Extra executables should be defined and implemented
    - @Alex what is this meant for?
- exit on invalid schema in a better way
- `envy status`
- validate existance of nativeExecutables
- different images based on config file
- make packages portable (homebrew?)
- Figure out how an envy down from within the Docker container will leave and tear it down. Unix sockets?? Should probably establish a good pattern for this.
