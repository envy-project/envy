MVP:

Ask Alex:
- Extra executables should be defined and implemented

Not MVP:
- pre-action command (i.e. start everything with `pipenv shell`)
- `envy status`
- better error handling (down / nuke / lint all error badly if up hasn't been run, up errors badly if docker isn't running, etc.)
- exit on invalid schema in a better way
- make packages portable (homebrew?)
- validate existance of nativeExecutables
- different images based on config file
