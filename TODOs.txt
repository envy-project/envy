- Build config file parsing
- Argument parsing & pretty-print tasks
- Run tasks using envy, without worrying about Docker
- envy up should dump you in the container (this is pretty much ready - make a ContainerFinder, call findAndEnsureRunning, then exec + attach /bin/bash)
- Container creation should probably have a volume?
- Investigate config hashing, goal is to avoid losing track of a container.
  - Omer suggested storing container and image ids in a .envy file
