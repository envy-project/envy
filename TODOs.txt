- Build config file parsing
- Argument parsing & pretty-print tasks
- Run tasks using envy, without worrying about Docker
- envy up should dump you in the container (this is pretty much ready - make a ContainerFinder, call findAndEnsureRunning, then exec + attach /bin/bash)
- Container creation - UID?
- Investigate config hashing, goal is to avoid losing track of a container.
  - Omer suggested storing container and image ids in a .envy file
- Figure out how an envy down from within the Docker container will leave and tear it down. Unix sockets?? Should probably establish a good pattern for this.
